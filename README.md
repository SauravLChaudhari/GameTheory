# Game Theory Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a game theory model to predict the stock price movements of Nifty50 stocks. The model uses the concept of Nash Equilibrium to understand how different players (investors) might behave given certain conditions.

## Description

The provided code demonstrates a basic game theory model with two players, each having two strategies: Buy (B) and Sell (S). The payoff matrices for both players are used to determine the Nash Equilibrium, which helps predict whether the stock price is likely to increase or decrease.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:
